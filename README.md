# LoronPigments
Loron Pigments is a website for selling paints and showcasing live samples of paints to users so that they can make decisions easily.
I developed this website using HTML and made it look nice using CSS.
User can come to the website, see the colors and their textures, and contact us or come to our office as a google map of our office is also included.
